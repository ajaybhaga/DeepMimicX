# DeepMimicX
Derivative of DeepMimic (https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/index.html) to determine feasibility on proposed experiments below.

Developer Email: ajay.bhaga@gmail.com & ajay.bhaga@munvo.com

Proposed experiments include using reference-based RL learning for:

-> Robotic agents with computer vision for trash collection, sorting and deposit.

-> Water sample classification and recycling targeting.

-> Spam-based filtering and decision trees based on reference models.
